##  Project Overview

- Developed a **Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** in a **Kali Linux environment** to detect malicious network traffic.
- Combined **Signature-Based Detection (rule-based logic)** with **Machine Learning-based Anomaly Detection** for improved cybersecurity performance.
- Implemented and compared three machine learning models:
  - 🔹 **Isolation Forest** (Unsupervised Anomaly Detection)
  - 🔹 **Random Forest** (Supervised Ensemble Learning)
  - 🔹 **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** Neural Network
- Trained and evaluated models using benchmark intrusion detection datasets.
- Achieved strong classification capability with **ROC-AUC = 0.94**.
- Selected **Random Forest** as the primary detection model based on stability and performance.
- Designed a **Hybrid OR-based decision engine** to combine ML and rule-based outputs.
- Built using **Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Joblib**, and tested within **Kali Linux**.
